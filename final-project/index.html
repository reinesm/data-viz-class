    <p align="justify">Monopoly, Clue, The Game of Life... Everyone's familiar with these board games. Whether you're an avid board game player
    or have only played the classics, you're probably missing out on some of the best games to play with friends.</p>

    <p align="justify">My boyfriend, Daniel, and I have recently been obsessed with board games, as evidenced by the picture above. So, I was
    inspired to seek out the best games. Lucky for you, here's my guide to the highest ranked board games on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame">BoardGameGeek.</a></p>

    <p align="justify">BoardGameGeek (BGG) is a website that holds millions of reviews and ratings on board games, posted by regular users and BGG's own community
    of experts. Below is data on the top 10 ranked board games.</p>

    <p align="justify">In addition to gathering data on the top 10 ranked board games, I also recorded information on the top 50 board games.
    Feel free to <i>play</i> around and explore the various attributes of the games.</p>

    <h2>Highest ranked board games are more costly but seem to be worth it</h2>

    <p align="justify">The top 10 board games aren't the cheapest, but if you're interested in investing in one of these popular games, here are their
    projected prices. After all, they must be the best games for a reason.</p>

        style = "width: 825px; height: 600px"></center>
    </figure>

    <br>

    <p align="justify">Most of the popular board games range from 2.8 to 4 in difficulty, which is on a maximum scale of 5. However, their prices
    seem to have no direct relation.</p>

    <p align="justify">Overall, it seems like you can find a game that could entertain yet challenge you for any price you're willing to pay.</p>

    <h2>These board games greatly outrank the classics</h2>

    <p align="justify">Although the top ranked board games are fairly expensive, it's worth noting that they have significantly higher average ratings
    compared to some of the more well-known board games, such as The Game of Life and Monopoly.</p>

  <h2>All in all, you're bound to find a gem among these games</h2>

    <p align="justify">Whenever you hang out next with friends or throw a party, consider purchasing one of these games.
    A little friendly competition never hurt nobody, and if you decide to play a co-op game, that can only bring you all
    closer together.</p>

    <p align="justify">Enjoy playing! Happy gaming!</p>
