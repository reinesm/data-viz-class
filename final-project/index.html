    or have only played the classics, you're probably missing out on some of the best games to play with pals.</p>

    <p align="justify">My boyfriend, Daniel, and I have recently been obsessed with board games, as evidenced by the picture above. So, I was
    inspired to seek out the best games. Lucky for you, here's my guide to the top 50 highest ranked board games on BoardGameGeek. </p>

    <p align="justify">BoardGameGeek (BGG) is a website that holds millions of reviews and ratings on board games, posted by regular users and BGG's own community

    <h2>Highest ranked board games are more costly but seem worth it</h2>

    <p align="justify">The top 10 board games aren't the cheapest, but if you're interested in investing in one of these popular games, here are their
    projected prices. After all, they must be the best games for a reason.</p>

    <p align="justify">Most of the popular board games range from 2.8 to 4 in difficulty, which is on a maximum scale of 5. However, their prices
    seem to have no direct relation.</p>

    <h2>These board games greatly outrank the classics</h2>

    <p align="justify">Although the top ranked board games are fairly expensive, it's worth noting that they have significantly higher average ratings
    compared to some of the more well-known board games, such as Monopoly and Clue.</p>
